# Human Stress Level Classification using ANN

## Overview
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify human stress levels based on 
daily lifestyle patterns. The model learns non-linear relationships between behavioral factors 
such as sleep duration, working hours, screen exposure, and physical activity to predict 
whether a person’s stress level is Low, Medium, or High.

The project demonstrates the practical use of neural networks in mental health analysis 
and lifestyle-based stress monitoring systems.

## Input Features
